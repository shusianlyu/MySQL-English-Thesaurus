## MySQL-English-Thesaurus

### About
An English Thesaurus, queries data from phpMyAdmin, which allows users to enter a word in English and get the definition of that word.

### Note
I just built one English Thesaurus application using Json file to store the data(you can find it in my repository named English-Thesaurus), however, that could lead to a problem with the performance of the application. Hence, I decided to use mysql database and the data will be stored in the remote database, which will improve the performance of this application.
